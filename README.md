# ~~Cloud~~CatWatch

Example for CloudWatch Synthetics to test a single page application.

## The App

The app is an single page application build with [Preact](https://preactjs.com), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev). It shows a collection of funny videos of cats. (Try not to laugh ðŸ˜Ž)

The source files can be found . For package manager and runtime we used the [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (`bun install` for installing packages).

For deployment we choose [SST (Ion)](https://ion.sst.dev) framework, to deploy to AWS Lambda.
